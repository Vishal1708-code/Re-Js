// Execeution Context
// Thread of Code
// Hoisting

// Exceution Context:The execution context is the environment in which javascript code is executed.
//there are two types of execution context:
// 1.global execution context:It is the default execution context,It handles the global scope code like function and variables which are decleared globaly.
// 2.Function exceution context:It is created when a function is called,It handles the code inside the function.

// Thread of Code:It is the sequence of code that is executed by the javascript engine.
// Javascript is a single threaded language, and non-blocking model for execution.It means it can only execute one code at a time.
//non-blocking model means it can execute the code without blocking the main thread.
// Hoisting:It is the process of moving the variable and function declarations to the top of the code before execution. 
// Hoisting is done by the javascript engine.
// Hoisting is done for variables and functions only, not for the values.

//In let and const hoisting is done but not initialized.
//In var hoisting is done and initialized with undefined.
